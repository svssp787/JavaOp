\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I would like to express my sincere thanks to my guide Dr. V Krishna Nandivada for his constant guidance, and motivation and for making me understand the different concepts of compilers and Analysis. Despite his busy schedule, weekly scheduled talks with him about the subject always inspired me to learn something new.

I would also like to thank Ramya, Omkar, Aman, and Prasoon from PACE Lab for helping me with the various concepts of Java, Soot, and Benchmarks. Thanks to all the Lab members for helping me by giving insights about various concepts.
