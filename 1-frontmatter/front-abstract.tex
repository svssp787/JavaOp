Many Java applications use Collection classes. Our main objective in this project is to improve the performance of those programs which use Java collection class and their methods. For that, we first studied different types of patterns in the usage of these methods and checked whether those can be optimized. The idea is to see if two or more sequence library calls with optimized method call.

Considering the generic nature of these patterns and typical optimization opportunities, we have designed a formal language (using CCAP grammar) using which the optmizable sequence of methods can be specified, along with the code (using the optimized method call) that can be used to replace the specified sequence of library calls.

Given a series of such optimization rules,we have designed a tool (CCAP tool) to automatically optimize input java applications.

we have done a preliminary investigation and found that CCAP tool can be used to optimize codes that are using collection class.
