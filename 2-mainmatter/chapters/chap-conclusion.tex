\chapter{Conclusion and Future Scope}

During this project, I studied the implementation of different methods in Java Collection classes and explored various methods in Soot for code analysis and creation. We designed a grammar and implemented new rules for optimizing Collection class accesses. After successfully modifying the follow-up tool, we were able to use it for both pattern identification and replacement, resulting in a significant performance improvement on micro benchmarks.

While working on the project, we observed that we can also optimize some patterns that do not belong to the Java Collection class. Therefore, for a given rule we can extend this tool to optimize any pattern, whether it belongs to the Collection class or any other class. We leave this as a future work.
